//! Main game logic for Snake.
//!
//! This module contains the main game logic for the game. It uses the safe, high-level API exposed
//! by the other modules in this crate. I have (and continue to) endeavour to keep this module well
//! documented and easy to understand.
//!
//! The main entry point for this module is [`game_main`] which expects that the terminal UI has
//! already been setup. This function runs the game through to completion.

/// 1. Calculate the number of free squares.
/// 2. Generate a random number between 0 and the number of free squares.
/// 3. Map the generated index onto the canvas (we iterate over the whole canvas, and only
///    increment on free squares).
