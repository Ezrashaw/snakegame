//! Main game logic for Snake.
//!
//! This module contains the main game logic for the game. It uses the safe, high-level API exposed
//! by the other modules in this crate. I have (and continue to) endeavour to keep this module well
//! documented and easy to understand.
//!
//! The main entry point for this module is [`game_main`] which expects that the terminal UI has
//! already been setup. This function runs the game through to completion.

/// 1. Choose a random location.
/// 2. If it is not free, then repeat 1.
/// 3. Place the fruit on the canvas.

/// This approach has a significant issue. When there are few free squares left (that is, when the
/// snake is very long), a possibly infinite number of random numbers might be generated. In other
/// words, there is no fixed upper time bound for this algorithm.
///
/// Instead, a better algorithm is used that is O(n) on the size of the canvas:
/// 1. Calculate the number of free squares.
/// 2. Generate a random number between 0 and the number of free squares.
/// 3. Map the generated index onto the canvas (we iterate over the whole canvas, and only
/// increment on free squares).
/// 4. Place the fruit on the canvas.
